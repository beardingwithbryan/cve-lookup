# cve-lookup
A tool to sort CVEs by their severity, number of exploits, and date. Good for organizing information during a pen test. Written by my friend Joseph and myself.

## Summary
This tool takes a list of CVE numbers as an input, and sorts them based on their severity, number of exploits, and date. The script checks with the NVD database and Rapid7's database to find the CVSS scores and exploit links. 

## API Keys
You will need to get an API key from NVD and assign its value to the <code>nvd_key</code> variable in the script. Information about the NVD API key can be found [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/news/API-Key-Announcement). Be sure to follow NVD's and Rapid7's best practices when it comes to using their APIs.
